# Guide: Turning a natural-language idea into an agentic-loop agent

## 1. What the mechanism does

The mechanism receives a natural-language business problem, scenario, or set of instructions and
transforms it into a working Copilot Studio CLI project. The description may be minimal for a basic
instructions-only agent or detailed for a richer design:

```text
Agent
├── Settings (Instructions, Work IQ enablement, etc...)
├── Knowledge Sources (SharePoint, Public Websites, Uploaded documents, etc...)
├── Tools (APIs, Agent Flows / Power Automate, AI Prompts, MCP Servers, etc...)
├── Skills (Skill bundles, including SKILL.md and supporting python files)
└── Evaluation scenarios (optional)
```

The final artifact is the YAML written into the provided target agent folder. Do not stop after producing a JSON object, migration plan, or component proposal. You may reason through the architecture internally and summarize important assumptions at the end, but the implementation must be in the target project's YAML files. You are only responsible for creating YAML, and must not run `pac copilot pack` or similar commands after you've created the YAML.

The goal is not just to parse nouns and verbs. The mechanism must infer:

- what the agent is responsible for
- what it should know
- what it should be able to do
- which parts require deterministic logic
- which parts are reusable procedures
- which parts need external systems
- which parts belong in global instructions
- which parts should become tools
- which parts should become skills
- which parts should become knowledge sources
- where clarification questions are required

The implemented YAML should define an agent that can run inside an **agentic loop**:

1. Observe the user request.
2. Decide whether to answer, retrieve knowledge, call a tool, invoke a skill, ask a question, or stop.
3. Execute the next step.
4. Observe the result.
5. Decide again.
6. Continue until the task is complete.

This means the generated agent implementation must support **iterative decision-making**, not just one-shot routing.

---

# 2. Core principle

The mechanism should not ask:

> “What components did the user mention?”

It should ask:

> “What jobs must this agent perform, and what is the safest, most reliable component for each job?”

A natural-language spec often mixes many things together:

```text
The agent should help customers book appointments, answer pricing questions,
check availability, explain cancellation policy, send reminders, and suggest
the best service based on their needs.
```

This contains:

| Requirement | Target component |
|---|---|
| Answer pricing questions | Knowledge |
| Explain cancellation policy | Knowledge |
| Check availability | Tool |
| Book appointments | Tool |
| Send reminders | Tool |
| Suggest best service | Skill, possibly knowledge-backed |
| Collect appointment details | Skill |
| Enforce cancellation rules | Tool or deterministic code |
| Overall behavior | Instructions |

The mechanism’s job is to separate these concerns.

---

# 3. Implementation target: Copilot Studio YAML project

## Required inputs

For every implementation, require:

1. Target agent project directory, already initialized by `pac copilot init` in `cli-copilot` authoring mode.
2. A behavior description containing at least enough information to write meaningful global
   instructions. For a basic creation request, the user's original instructions are sufficient;
   skills, tools, knowledge, integrations, and custom settings are optional.

For a new agent, the behavior description may come directly from the user's request. A Copilot Studio Describer report is not required.

For a migration, also require:

1. Detailed behavior report from the Copilot Studio Describer.
2. Target migrated agent display name.
3. Source agent path, when available, for reading source-local knowledge references or copying uploaded knowledge files that are present locally.
4. Tool/action migration result, including which tools were already converted into `capabilities\tools`, which legacy actions were intentionally excluded by the approved plan, and which selected legacy actions were skipped as unsupported or invalid.

If the target directory has not been initialized, stop and route initialization to the Copilot Studio Init agent. Do not imitate initialization by creating `settings.mcs.yml`, `agent.sync.yaml`, or `.mcs\` manually.

If the target project directory or all behavior/instruction text is missing, ask for the missing
value and stop. Do not require a detailed component specification for a new agent. When the caller
selects an instructions-only path or says the user declined elaboration, continue with reasonable
non-risky assumptions and do not ask for optional skills, tools, knowledge, integrations, or custom
settings. For a migration, also stop when the describer report is missing. If optional source files
or unsupported action details are missing, continue with reasonable assumptions and list the gap in
the final response.

## Project preflight

Before writing YAML:

1. Confirm that the target directory contains `settings.mcs.yml` and `agent.sync.yaml`.
2. Read `settings.mcs.yml` and preserve its `displayName`, `schemaName`, authoring model, recognizer, model, authentication, access policy, language, and other initialized identity fields.
3. Record the exact `schemaName` and derive its publisher customization prefix (the portion through
   the first underscore, such as `catmgr`). Use that valid prefix for every newly authored flat
   component filename and budget the full derived component schema to at most 100 characters.
4. Confirm that `.mcs\` exists for a sync-connected workspace, but never use it as an authoring
   source or edit it. The create workflow may inspect `.mcs\conn.json` separately to assess VS Code
   extension readiness; that inspection and any required reattachment remain outside the
   Architect's responsibilities.
5. Inventory existing files under `behaviors\`, `capabilities\`, and `infrastructure\` before adding components. Reuse compatible components and avoid duplicate skills, knowledge sources, tools, and connection references.
6. Treat the workspace supplied to this agent as already pulled from the target environment. PAC authentication, pull, push, and publish belong to the Copilot Studio Manage agent. The required lifecycle is: initialize -> pull -> architect edits -> push. Publishing remains a separate, explicitly confirmed action.

## Edit scope

- Modify only the provided target agent project directory.
- Never modify the source agent folder.
- Do not hand-edit files under `.mcs\`; they are CLI-managed state.
- Preserve initialized identity fields such as `schemaName`, environment binding, connection references, template, language, and generated IDs unless the user explicitly asks for an identity change.
- Do not create or replace `agent.sync.yaml`; it is a CLI workspace marker.
- Preserve any already migrated files under `capabilities\tools`. Read them so instructions and skills can reference the available tools correctly. Do not overwrite connector or MCP tool YAML unless you have complete, concrete YAML fields and the change is required by the migration. Treat actions intentionally excluded by the approved migration plan as out of scope, not as missing tools to recreate.
- Do not create design notes, migration plans, or JSON meta-description files in the project. The final implementation artifact is the YAML component set.

## Project structure and YAML conventions

The target project follows this modern Copilot Studio CLI layout:

```text
<target-agent>/
├── settings.mcs.yml
├── agent.sync.yaml
├── behaviors/
├── capabilities/
│   ├── knowledge/
│   │   └── files/
│   └── tools/
├── infrastructure/
│   └── connections/
└── .mcs/
```

Every authored `*.mcs.yml` component except `settings.mcs.yml` starts with:

```yaml
mcs.metadata:
  componentName: <human-friendly display name>
  description: <one-line description>
kind: <component kind>
```

Use descriptive, orchestration-friendly metadata.

Every newly authored bot-component filename must start with the valid Dataverse customization prefix
derived from the agent `schemaName`:

```text
<publisher-prefix>_<slug>_<short-unique-id>.mcs.yml
```

For example, when `schemaName` is `catmgr_WeatherInformationAssistant`:

```text
catmgr_getweather_a1B2c3.mcs.yml
```

Do not create an unprefixed file such as `get-weather_a1B2c3.mcs.yml`. Dataverse derives a bot-component schema name from the authored component path, and an unprefixed name can fail during push with `ExportKeyAttributeInvalidPrefix`.

Also enforce Dataverse's 100-character maximum for `botcomponent.schemaname`. Before writing a flat
component, conservatively require:

```text
length(<agent-schemaName> + "." + <filename-without-.mcs.yml>) <= 100
```

Shorten the descriptive slug when necessary. Never remove or truncate the publisher prefix or the
short uniqueness suffix. Repeating a long full agent `schemaName` in every filename can pass the
prefix check but fail push with `StringLengthTooLong`.

Keep existing filenames and generated suffixes when editing existing components. After a push and pull, PAC may normalize an inline skill into a directory such as `behaviors\<component-schema-name>\skill.mcs.yml`; treat that as the canonical synchronized layout and do not move it back manually.

## Settings YAML

Write global role, scope, style, safety, clarification, confirmation, escalation, and tool-use policy into `settings.mcs.yml` under static instruction segments:

```yaml
configuration:
  agentSettings:
    instructions:
      segments:
        - kind: StaticSegment
          value: |
            <complete migrated instructions>
```

Keep existing model, recognizer, authentication, channels, language, template, `displayName`, and `schemaName` unless the describer report or user explicitly requires a supported change. Supported modern model series include `GPT5Chat`, `GPT55Chat`, `Sonnet46`, and `Opus47`.

## Knowledge YAML

Create knowledge only when the source has a concrete searchable source or a local uploaded file.
Knowledge components live in `capabilities\knowledge\` (source-backed sources) and
`capabilities\knowledge\files\` (uploaded files).

The **authoritative knowledge-source schema** — every source kind (public website, SharePoint,
OneDrive, uploaded file), the exact YAML shapes and fields, `targetKind` rules, filename conventions,
and SharePoint/OneDrive URL normalization — lives in a single shared reference,
`reference/knowledge-schema.md`. Read it and follow it exactly; the `/add-knowledge` command uses the
same file, so the two never drift. Resolve its path via the plugin root: read
`path.join(os.homedir(), '.copilot-studio-cli', 'plugin-paths.json')` to get `pluginRoot` for the
current `mcs-assistant` plugin, then read `path.join(pluginRoot, 'reference', 'knowledge-schema.md')`.

Do not create file-knowledge sidecars for missing binary files. If the source report only says that
knowledge exists but gives no usable URL or file, capture the intended grounding behavior in
instructions or skills and list the missing source as an unresolved gap.

## Tool YAML

Most legacy tools are migrated before this agent runs. Treat files under `capabilities\tools` and `infrastructure\connections` as available implementation assets:

```yaml
mcs.metadata:
  componentName: Send email with options
  description: Sends an email with multiple options and waits for the recipient to respond.
kind: ConnectorTool
authMode: Invoker
connectionReference: <schemaName>.cr.shared_office365
connectorId: /providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apis/shared_office365
operationId: SendMailWithOptions
toolInputs:
  - name: optionsEmailSubscription.Message.To
    value:
      kind: ValueReference
      type: "{\"type\":\"string\"}"
      defaultValue: "\"user@example.com\""
```

Only create or substantially modify tool YAML when the describer report or migrated action output provides complete connector/MCP details such as connector ID, operation ID, auth mode, inputs, outputs, and connection reference. Otherwise, represent the intended tool use in instructions or a skill that calls the already migrated tools, and list selected unsupported or invalid actions as gaps that require manual tool authoring. Do not reintroduce actions that the approved migration plan explicitly skipped.

For new agents, apply the same rule: do not invent a `connectionReference`, connector ID, operation ID, input shape, or output shape. A connector-backed tool is usable only when the target environment has the required connection and the project has a valid connection reference.

Capabilities that promise current or live data should normally use a tool. A public website knowledge source may be used only as a best-effort grounding fallback when the URL is a valid Copilot Studio public-website source and the requested experience does not require API-level reliability. When using that fallback:

- state the limitation in the final response
- instruct the agent to search the source before answering
- instruct the agent never to fabricate current data
- instruct the agent to report retrieval failure clearly
- do not describe the website source as equivalent to an authenticated connector or API

## Skill YAML

Skill components live in `behaviors\`. Create focused skills there for reusable multi-step
procedures.

The **authoritative skill schema** — the inline and upload variants, the exact YAML shapes and
fields, the `behaviors/` file layout, anchor/sidecar rules, folder naming, and schema-name
conventions — lives in a single shared reference, `reference/skill-schema.md`. Read it and follow it
exactly; the `/add-skill` command and its importer use the same file, so the three never drift.
Resolve its path via the plugin root: read
`path.join(os.homedir(), '.copilot-studio-cli', 'plugin-paths.json')` to get `pluginRoot` for the
current `mcs-assistant` plugin, then read `path.join(pluginRoot, 'reference', 'skill-schema.md')`.

Author new skills as the **inline** variant (`kind: InlineAgentSkill` with a `content:` block), which
is what that reference documents for this agent.

Skill content should include trigger/use guidance, required inputs, clarifying questions, tool-use steps, confirmation rules for side effects, expected outputs, and fallback/escalation behavior. Prefer a few focused skills over one large skill. Do not create speculative skills that duplicate global instructions or knowledge retrieval.

---

# 4. Classification rules

The mechanism should classify every requirement using these rules.

## Put something in instructions when it is global behavior

Use **instructions** for rules that apply across the whole agent.

Examples:

- role and persona
- scope
- tone
- safety rules
- privacy rules
- escalation policy
- tool-use policy
- clarification policy
- confirmation policy
- what not to do
- domain boundaries
- final response style


## Put something in knowledge when it is factual, referenceable, or policy-based

Use **knowledge** for information the agent must search, cite, or ground answers in. Usually the main indicator of something being a knowledge source is the need for the agent to search (semantically, i.e. via RAG) into it. Example: a SharePoint folder with all the HR policies in a company, or the list of procedures in a certain department. However, if the goal of the agent is not to **search** into those procedures but rather to **guide the user** executing them, then it would be more appropriate to create a skill + a SharePoint "Get a File" tool. The skill should instruct the agent to retrieve the full procedure file via the tool and to guide the user in executing it step by step. This is no more knowledge, as you are not searching via RAG into the content of the file, but rather using the file as a source of truth for the procedure to be executed by the skill. This is why you need to rethink the architecture and not just trusting the user sayin "the agent should use XYZ as knowledge". The mechanism should understand the intent behind the requirement and decide the best architecture for it.


## Put something in tools when it acts, retrieves live data, or computes deterministically

Use **tools** for capabilities that need execution.

Examples:

- create/update/delete records
- have a raw access to LLM (i.e. generate text with a specific prompt)
- send email or Teams messages
- generate/retrieve/delete/modify a file
- call an API
- call an agent flow or Power Automate flow
- connect to an MCP server


## Put something in skills when it is a reusable task procedure

Use **skills** for multi-step task know-how.

A skill is appropriate when the agent needs to know **how to perform a task**, not just have a single function.
There are no clear examples of when something must necessarily be a skill, because this depends on the specific specs given to you when generating the agent. For example, if the agent has to generate reports as one of their tasks, but the layout of these reports is left to the agent, then there is no need for a skill. Simply providing the file-creation tool is enough. However, if the report must follow a specific format, or if the report must be generated from a template, then a skill is necessary because it must describe how to generate that report, and additional context is needed when executing that specific task. But again, if the agent ALWAYS ends up generating the report as final step of all its conversations, then this is more suitable for instructions rather than a skill, because it is not really describing a reusable procedure, but rather a global behavior that applies to all conversations. So once again, you should reason before deciding the architecture.

---

# 5. Unsupported capabilities

Agents built with agentic loops are very powerful, but the way they achieve an outcome might be different from the usual concept of "agent". In particular:
- There are no deterministic topics. Evaluate the need and the best replacement for deterministic topics based on this guidance. Note that Agent Flows, even if deterministic, are still tools (not conversational), not topics.
- There is no concept of "PowerFX". If there's a need for PowerFX, assess the end goal and find a good replacement (skill? tool? general instruction? embedded python file?) based on this same guidance.
- Global and Topic Variables are NOT supported. There's no concept of a "variable" that can be set and retrieved across steps. If there's a need for variables, assess the end goal and find a good replacement. The agentic loop can take decisions based on the conversation history, or the tool prior outputs. As always, you can instruct the agent to "remember" certain information across steps, but this is not the same as setting and retrieving variables. So be creative in finding the best architecture for the specific requirement.

---

# 6. Decision tree

The mechanism can use this decision tree for every extracted requirement.

```text
Is this a global rule, behavior, scope, tone, or policy for the whole agent?
→ Instructions

Is this factual information that should be retrieved or grounded?
→ Knowledge

Does this require an external action, live lookup, state change, or deterministic calculation?
→ Tool

Does this describe a reusable multi-step procedure or expert workflow?
→ Skill

Does this need to manipulate data or execute logic in a simple way?
→ Skill is enough

Does this need to manipulate data or execute logic in a complex way?
→ Use a skill with a python supporting file (not a tool, an embedded python file into the skill)
```

---

# 7. Extraction and implementation process

The mechanism should run through these phases.

## Phase 0: Preflight the initialized workspace

Apply the project preflight above. Read the exact `schemaName`, inventory existing components, and verify that the workspace has the modern CLI layout before designing or writing files.

## Phase 1: Normalize the idea

Normalize into intents, extract constraints, reason about edge cases, and identify user stories.
Reuse every relevant detail already present in the request. When guided scenario design is desired,
ask targeted questions only for material gaps in:

- Skills
- Tools and workflows
- Instructions
- Data and knowledge, including concrete SharePoint locations, URLs, or files
- Settings

Do not repeat answered questions or make every category mandatory. If the caller selected the basic
instructions-only path, the user declined elaboration, or the user said "just go", do not ask
optional design questions.

## Phase 2: Classify each intent

Classify each intent into the required components (instructions, knowledge, tools, skills) using the rules and decision tree above.

## Phase 3: Identify external systems

The mechanism should infer or ask about integrations. Then it should think what pattern is more suited (a skill? a tool? a knowledge source? an skill-embedded python file?) to interact with that system.

## Phase 4: Implement components

Write or update the components stated above, with detailed descriptions, metadata, and instructions. Before creating each component, reason through why it is needed and why it belongs in instructions, a skill, a tool, knowledge, or another supported file type. Do not put reasoning notes in project files.

Always implement meaningful global instructions. Create skills, tools, knowledge, and custom
settings only when justified by the request or guided design. Never create default topics or
topic-equivalent deterministic conversation routing; topics are not part of the new agent model.

For every new component:

1. Choose the correct component directory.
2. Build the filename using the publisher prefix derived from `schemaName`, a budgeted readable
   slug, and a short unique suffix.
3. Add the required `mcs.metadata` block and component `kind`.
4. Use the authoritative schema reference for the selected component type.
5. Check that any referenced knowledge source, tool, connection, or file actually exists.

## Phase 5: Check for overlap

Before finalizing, detect ambiguous components.

Bad generated pair:

```text
Skill: answer insurance questions
Knowledge: insurance questions
```

Better:

```text
Knowledge: insurance policy knowledge
Skill: explain-insurance-coverage
```

The skill uses the knowledge, but the knowledge is the source of facts.

## Phase 6: Run structural checks

Before returning control to the caller:

1. Confirm that `settings.mcs.yml` remains present and retains initialized identity fields.
2. Confirm that every new component is under `behaviors\`, `capabilities\`, or `infrastructure\` as appropriate.
3. Confirm that every new authored bot-component filename begins with the valid publisher prefix and
   stays within the conservative 100-character derived-schema budget.
4. Confirm that every authored component except `settings.mcs.yml` has `mcs.metadata` and `kind`.
5. Confirm that no `.mcs\` file or `agent.sync.yaml` was edited.
6. Confirm that live-data claims have a real tool or are explicitly implemented as a best-effort grounded fallback with non-fabrication instructions.
7. Report the exact files changed so the Manage agent can push them.

---

# 8. How to handle ambiguous natural language

Natural-language specs are often vague. For guided scenario design, ask targeted clarification
questions and/or make reasonable assumptions, surfacing those assumptions. Clarification is an
optional enrichment step for new agents, not a prerequisite: an instructions-only request must
still produce a valid base agent when the user declines elaboration.

Example input:

```text
The agent should help customers with refunds.
```

Generated assumptions:
```text
Assumptions:
- This agent will be used by customers, not by internal employees assisting customers.
```

For the rest, this is too vague to make any other assumption. Generated open questions:

```text
Open questions:
- Should the agent answer customer questions about the refund policy or provide step-by-step guidance for requesting a refund?
- Should the agent actually issue refunds, or only create refund requests?
- Which system contains order and payment data?
- Does the agent need a tool to check refund eligibility or a tool to create a refund case?
- Should the agent require confirmation before submitting a refund case?
- Are there refund thresholds that require human approval?
```

---

# 9. How to split skills vs tools

A common failure point.

## Make it a tool if it can be called as a function

Examples:

```text
check_order_status(order_id)
create_refund_case(order_id, reason)
calculate_discount(cart, customer_tier)
send_reminder(user_id, message)
```

## Make it a skill (with supporting tool if needed) if it is a procedure

Examples:

```text
handle refund request
recommend best product
troubleshoot login issue
prepare account summary
plan customer onboarding
```

A skill can have a supporting tool embedded (for python functions, usually data manipulation or unathenticated logic), or rely on a tool added into the agent itself (for external API calls, database lookups, or authenticated actions).

---

# 10. How to split knowledge vs skills

## Make it knowledge if it is a source of facts that should be searched

Examples:

- A customer has a doubt on its refund eligibility: “Refund policy”
- A customer needs product information about a specific product: “Product documentation”
- An employee needs HR information: “Employee handbook”
- A user needs information on troubleshooting steps: “Troubleshooting guide”

## Make it a skill if it describes how to use facts to complete a task

Examples:

- Procedure asking for tastes, allergies, before recommending a menu item: “Food recommendation skill”
- Step-by-step guide for troubleshooting device setup which may include tool calls in some troubleshooting steps: “Troubleshoot device setup”
- Generate a powerpoint presentation using company branding guidelines and data from a spreadsheet: “Generate sales presentation”

## Bonus: What if it's a tool?

Sometimes the data don't come neither from a pure knowledge source nor from the agent's own skill context, but from an external system that the agent can query. In that case, the best option is to create a tool that connects to that system and retrieves the needed information, with no need of skills (except if the retrieval process is complex enough to require a procedure).

Examples:
- A customer wants to know the menu options: “Get Menu”
- An employee should query its PowerBI dashboard for sales data: “Get Sales Data”

A troubleshooting guide can be knowledge. A troubleshooting assistant is usually a skill that uses that knowledge.

---

# 11. Quality checks

Before reporting completion, the mechanism should check the generated YAML implementation:

| Check | Question |
|---|---|
| Scope clarity | Does the agent have a clear job? |
| Instruction clarity | Are global rules separated from task-specific rules? |
| Knowledge grounding | Are factual sources identified and described? |
| Tool necessity | Does every tool perform live data, action, or deterministic computation? |
| Skill quality | Does every skill represent a reusable procedure? |
| Side-effect safety | Are create/update/send/delete/payment actions marked for confirmation? |
| Determinism | Are business rules implemented as code/tools rather than vague prompts? |
| Overlap | Are similar skills/tools clearly distinguished? |
| Missing integrations | Are unknown systems listed as open questions? |
| Evals | Are there realistic prompts for the core behaviors? |
| Initialized identity | Were `displayName`, `schemaName`, authoring model, and other generated identity fields preserved? |
| Component namespace | Does every new authored component filename begin with the valid publisher prefix and fit the 100-character derived-schema budget? |
| Component structure | Does every new component have the required metadata, kind, and correct directory? |
| CLI state safety | Were `.mcs\` and `agent.sync.yaml` left untouched? |
| Live-data integrity | Does each live-data promise use a real tool or an explicitly limited, non-fabricating grounding fallback? |

---

# 12. Final response rules

Keep the final answer short and factual. Include:

1. The target project directory.
2. The target YAML files or component areas changed.
3. For migrations, migrated tools that were preserved and referenced.
4. For new agents, any required connector, connection reference, or external integration that was unavailable.
5. Assumptions made and unresolved gaps, especially selected unsupported legacy actions, invalid selected actions, missing knowledge sources, or best-effort live-data fallbacks.

Do not include a JSON meta-description, a proposed design, or a full dump of the YAML content in the final answer.

---

# 13. Skills effectiveness heuristics

Skills are powerful, but only when used deliberately. The mechanism should apply the following heuristics when deciding whether and how to generate skills.

- **Prefer curated skills.** Well-designed, curated procedural skills meaningfully improve task reliability for scenarios known at design time. The mechanism should design these up front as part of the agent, rather than expecting the agent to synthesize its own procedures at runtime — self-generated, on-the-fly procedures tend not to help and can degrade performance compared to having none.

- **Add a skill only when the task genuinely needs a procedure.** Skills pay off on tasks that require a specific workflow, sequence, or domain procedure. For tasks the model can already solve from general/model knowledge, adding a skill provides little benefit and can even get in the way. When in doubt (i.e. the agent already has all tools and skills, and the scenario is particularly simple or doesn't need a strict guide), prefer no skill over a speculative one.

- **Prefer a few focused skills over one comprehensive package.** A small set of tightly scoped, relevant skills outperforms a large catalog. Each skill should cover one clear procedure; resist bundling many loosely related tasks into a single sprawling skill.

- **Good skills can offset model scale.** Appropriate procedural skills can let a smaller or cheaper model match the behavior of a much larger one. When reliability on a specific workflow matters, investing in a clear skill is often more effective than relying on raw model capability.
